\section{Personal projects}

\begin{adcvtabletwo}
  \textbf{Suadeo (2020-Present) - }
  Social network application for tv \& movies. Written in react native and nodejs express for the middletier and neo4j for the database.
  
  \adcvrowskip
  \adcvrowskip
  
  \textbf{Barnyard Fart Fest (2014-2017) - }
  Developed a memory type matching game for all ages. This is my first ever game, though it didn't do well I learned a lot about graphics, animations \& OpenGL. The game was published as a multi-platform for android & iOS and was written in Java.

  \textbf{Binary Clock Wallpaper (2015) - }
  A simple, efficient live wallpaper for android. This was my first published app to the market.
  
  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bazos.wallpaper.binary.lite

  \textbf{Web Mail Scraper Outlook (2015) - }
  Developed a free application that will screen scraper an OWA 2007 website so you can check your mail natively on your Android device. Also includes notifications when new messages arrive.  This was built because many corporate environments don’t allow you to setup your email on your personal phone. This app had over 100k+ downloads.

  \adcvrowskip
  \textbf{Disposable Camera App (2015) - }
  Developed a disposable camera application for my wedding that allows users to take pictures that instantly get uploaded to my personal website.  In addition to that users can also view a live slide show of the pictures as they are being uploaded.  Part of being a disposable camera is there is no way to delete a photo.  Once it is taken it cannot be removed.  To prevent bogus photos from people not at the wedding I use geocoding to ensure they were within an appropriate distance of the venue.  This is not currently on the Google Play Store as it was removed after I was married.
