\section{Personal projects}

\begin{adcvtabletwo}
  \textbf{Suadeo (2020-Present) - }
  ...

  \textbf{Barnyard Fart Fest (2014-2017) - }
  Developed a memory type matching game for all ages.  This is my first game I did the development from the ground up.  In the process I had to learn about animations and OpenGl.  Also this game is multt-platform so I simultaneously released it on both Google Play Store

  \textbf{Binary Clock Wallpaper (2015) - }
  Built this as my first Android application to get a feeling for how the process of developing and putting android application on the market works.
  
  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bazos.wallpaper.binary.lite

  \textbf{Web Mail Scraper Outlook (2015) - }
  Developed a free application that will screen scraper an OWA 2007 website so you can check your mail natively on your Android device. Also includes notifications when new messages arrive.  This was built because many corporate environments don’t allow you to setup your email on your personal phone. This was my first app to have 100k+ downloads.

  \adcvrowskip
  \textbf{Disposable Camera App (2015) - }
  Developed a disposable camera application for my wedding that allows users to take pictures that instantly get uploaded to my personal website.  In addition to that users can also view a live slide show of the pictures as they are being uploaded.  Part of being a disposable camera is there is no way to delete a photo.  Once it is taken it cannot be removed.  To prevent bogus photos from people not at the wedding I use geocoding to ensure they were within an appropriate distance of the venue.  This is not currently on the Google Play Store as it was removed after I was married.
